TODO

Need to properly comment functions to keep code readable to others.

Create Dynamic HTML:
    If no events, do not list venue
    Create key:value pair for each venue and event. If no event, do not render html.
    {% for key, value in result.items() %}
            <tr>
               <th> {{ key }} </th>
               <td> {{ value }} </td>
            </tr>
         {% endfor %}

    Dictionary of Lists {x: [1,2,3]}
    Need function that creates dictionary with every venue as key, set value to the return of each venue function in list.

Create page for venues being tracked.
