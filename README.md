# chs-tonight-2.0
A remake of the [chs-tonight]('https://github.com/DanHanf/chs-source') website that seems to no longer be maintained.
The original site was written in React. This remake is powered by Python and Flask.

This project is more of a learning experience than anything else. There are most likely more elegant ways of gathering
this information. As such, this project's code will be constantly updated as I learn more about the technologies being used.


## Setup

### Requirements
If you wish to run your own instance of this site remember to install all requirements with the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
### Flask Setup
In order to run the flask instance run the following commands:

##### Linux Environment:
```
export FLASK_APP=hello.py
flask run
```
or
```
python hello.py
```

##### Windows Environment:

```
set FLASK_APP=hello.py
flask run
```

or
```
python hello.py
```
